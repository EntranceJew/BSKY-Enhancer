# BSKY-Enhancer
Quality of life improvements for BSKY, including enforced highest quality video playback.

Currently the only thing it does is enforce that video quality playback, but I intend to add features like I have in my Twitter-AutoHD script, most importantly the right-click saving that includes creator's details in the filename, and video downloading.

May add timeline width adjustment at some point as well.
