# BSKY-Enhancer
Quality of life improvements for BSKY, including enforced highest quality video playback.

Currently the only enforces high-quality video and adds a Download button for videos (if it doesn't show, open the post in a new tab or refresh)<br/><br/>
I intend to add features like I have in my Twitter-AutoHD script, most importantly the right-click saving that includes creator's details in the filename, and video downloading.
<br/>
May add timeline width adjustment at some point as well.
